                        The WSIB Innovation Lab operates out of Communitech, a digital hub. During Summer 2020, I worked on Safe@Lab, a product focused on transitioning our team from work-from-home to in-person work post COVID as Ontario goes through each stage of the pandemic.

                        technology.

                        The WSIB Innovation Lab wants its members stay safe and comply with Communitech standards when we return to in-person work. A part of this is limiting in-person interactions while enhancing the experience of coming into work during the latter stages of

                        As Ontario enters Stage 3, Communitech has recently opened its doors and has allowed a minimal number of employees come in-person. However, in a future filled with uncertainty of when in-person work will resume, the Lab needs to ensure this transition
                        is safe.

                        The initial idea brought into the Lab was a contact-tracing like app that could be used for all WSIB staff, an application called Safe@Work. When creating Safe@Work, we performed extensive competitive analysis between other contact tracing applications,
                        and built off of their flaws.

                    <div class="regular">
                        In addition to this, our research included screener surveys, time-intervals of when contact tracing was automatically turned on and geo-fencing for location-based contact tracing. Safe@Work provided us with the groundwork for a simple contact tracing
                        application which could be used as the foundation for our in-Lab application, Safe@Lab.
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <div class="regular">
                        We wanted to understand how we could better tailor Safe@Lab to our lab-staff, who are more on the move and used to collaborating with teammates. In addition, since many lab staff were used to working out of Communitech, it was imperative that our application
                        could handle a potential transition of in-person work.

                    <div class="regular">
                        Thus, our design team wanted to investigate the importance of what safety and collaboration between teams matter to each Lab mate. We started by interviewing each of our Lab mates to see what mattered to them when transitioning to in-person work.
